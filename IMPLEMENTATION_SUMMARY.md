# 🏆 **MCP Taste Recommendation Server - Hero Implementation**

> **COMPLETE** - Advanced taste-based content recommendation engine for Pooch AI Hackathon  
> *No compromises on quality. Full sophisticated framework implementation.*

## 🎯 **What We Built**

A **revolutionary content recommendation system** that analyzes **WHY** users like content, not just WHAT they like. This isn't your typical genre-based recommendation engine - it's a sophisticated taste interpreter implementing advanced prompt engineering.

### **🧠 Core Innovation: Master Taste Interpreter**

Instead of asking "What genre do you like?", our system analyzes:

1. **🧬 Narrative DNA Extraction**
   - Story structure preferences (episodic vs serialized, character vs plot-driven)
   - Pacing preferences (slow burn vs quick cuts vs deliberate builds)
   - Conflict styles (internal growth vs external obstacles vs interpersonal)
   - Resolution patterns (ambiguous vs clear closure vs ongoing mysteries)

2. **💫 Emotional Texture Mapping**
   - Primary mood delivery (cozy comfort, intellectual stimulation, cathartic release, escapist fantasy)
   - Emotional journey types (steady state, rollercoaster, gradual build, surprising shifts)
   - Intensity comfort levels (background viewing vs full attention required)
   - Character relationship preferences (aspirational, relatable, observational, protective)

3. **🎨 Stylistic Signature Detection**
   - **Visual Content**: Naturalistic vs stylized, understated vs theatrical, technical craft appreciation
   - **Audio Content**: Host dynamics, delivery styles, intimacy levels, production values

4. **⚡ Anti-Pattern Identification**
   - Deal-breakers (forced laugh tracks, excessive violence, slow pacing)
   - Tone violations (cringe humor, melodrama)
   - Structural issues (rushed endings, predictable arcs)
   - Context mismatches (attention requirements)

## 📊 **6-Factor Evaluation Matrix**

Every piece of content is scored across six dimensions:

1. **Taste Match Strength** (1-10): How well it delivers extracted taste elements
2. **Anti-Pattern Avoidance** (1-10): How well it avoids user's stated dislikes
3. **Context Fit** (1-10): Matches current mood/energy/time available
4. **Discovery Value** (1-10): Introduces something new within taste profile
5. **Source Validation** (1-10): Quality of discovery source (creator rec > algorithm)
6. **Craft Quality** (1-10): Evidence of intentional creative choices

### **Core Classes Implemented:**

**Data Models (9 Classes):**
- `NarrativeDNA` - Story structure preferences
- `EmotionalTexture` - Emotional experience mapping
- `VisualStylePreferences` - Visual content style analysis
- `AudioStylePreferences` - Podcast/audio content analysis
- `AntiPatterns` - What to avoid detection
- `EnhancedTasteProfile` - Comprehensive user taste profile
- `EvaluationScore` - 6-factor scoring system
- `EnhancedRecommendation` - Rich recommendation with explanations
- `MasterTasteInterpreter` - Main analysis engine

**Key Methods:**
- `extract_taste_profile()` - Advanced pattern matching and analysis
- `generate_recommendations()` - 6-factor evaluation and ranking
- `format_recommendations_for_whatsapp()` - Perfect chat formatting
- `evaluate_content()` - Comprehensive content scoring
- `handle_contextual_requests()` - Special request type handling

## 🔧 **MCP Protocol 2025-06-18 Compliance**

**✅ Fully Compliant Implementation:**
- Protocol version enforcement via `MCP-Protocol-Version` header
- No JSON-RPC batching (removed in 2025-06-18 spec)
- Bearer token authentication with security validation
- Origin header validation for DNS rebinding protection
- HTTPS serving requirement (via ngrok for development)
- Proper JSON-RPC 2.0 error handling

**MCP Tools Implemented:**
1. `validate` - Phone number validation for Pooch
2. `get_taste_recommendations` - Main recommendation engine
3. `extract_taste_profile` - Taste analysis without recommendations
4. `handle_contextual_request` - Special request type handling

## 📚 **Content Database**

**Comprehensive Content Mapping:**
- TV Shows: Shrinking, Atlanta, Reservation Dogs, Severance, The Bear, Ted Lasso
- Podcasts: Radiolab, Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend
- Each entry includes: Quality indicators, source validation, craft elements
- Full taste profile mapping for accurate matching

**Quality Indicators:**
- Film director involvement (+2 points)
